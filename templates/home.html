      I am a web developer with a passion for cutting edge technologies, uber user interactions and clean
      intuitive interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working with JavaScript (MEAN stack rocks), but not afraid to roll up my sleeves and dig
      into some python, ruby or PHP with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

      This project was designed in the browser.It started after a phone interview I had with a company
      looking for a frontend developer. Flask was mentioned and it sounded interesting to me so I did
      some research on it.
      </p>
    <p>
      Basically I just started coding it up, no design to go from, everything was done as I learned.
      The styles evolved from using chrome dev tools and live reload. Once I had a basic color scheme,
      I wanted to keep it clean. The styles and effects where kept to a minimal and enhanced the user
      experience, while maintaining an aesthetic. Granted it's just a prototype so fine tuning would
      be done after the prototype was approved. I had to show that I knew my stuff so I had some
      cool css3 3d transitions and sprinkles of css goodness here and there.

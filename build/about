      <h2>A little bit about myself.</h2>
      <h3>and what I do</h3>

    <article class='about'>
      <p>
        I am a web developer with a passion for cutting edge technologies, uber user interactions and clean
        intuitive interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 5 years I've been learning various languages and skills, all related
        to the web. I went back to school for web design and interactive media. I was totally into
        flash at the time and learned AS3, plus that was the programming language taught at the collage
        I went to.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first couple of years learning everything from design to development.
        I figured out pretty quickly what I had to do to achieve my goals of becoming a web
        master! I first learned how to design the sites, using tools like Photoshop and Illustrator
        then I learned how to code them up with standards HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript for
        client side validation and UI control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we learned how to analyze the user experience, card sorting, persona's, usability
        testing Information architecture. I read books like `Don't make me think` by Steve Krug
        and I loved every minute of it. School showed me all the tools I needed to succeed in
        whatever direction I wanted to go in, <em>Information Architecture, Usability, Design,
        Development</em> it's up to the individual to take it the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I left school, I taught myself how to work with databases with PHP and MySQL,
        It was very exciting, and I all I wanted to do was learn more about web development,
        and couldn't get enough. Once I found out about NodeJS on the server, MongoDB
        on the database and Backbone on the frontend, I was hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had a chance to intern at a great company in Boston called
        <a href='http://www.inphantry.com/' target='_blank'>Inphantry</a>. I learned alot about how to
        work under short deadlines and high pressure. I worked on some major
        brands there. I've done some freelance work as well, some of it under
        a NDA agreement. I worked on `So you think you can dance` project. I
        worked with teams from all over the world and delt with huge files.
        LESS was used to handle the css and Symphony PHP framework using twig
        templates. It was an amazing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking to join a team and take my career to the next level.
        Until then, I'll just keep learning and growing as a developer and a human being.

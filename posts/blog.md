# Final touches to blog

Well, I've managed to hobble together a blog
built with Flask despite having the flu.

I just have to add a RSS feed and figure out how to tie some of my work into this.

Would be nice to have some navigation to an about page, contact page etc..
I'll start working on that as soon as I get this live.

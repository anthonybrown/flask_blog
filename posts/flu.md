title: Bad Time to be Sick

# Bad time to have the flu

_Like there ever is a good time?_

There is never a good time to get sick with the flu,
working on my flask blog to show to a potential employer
while having the flu is really really bad.

Progress has been slow, but I just keep doing
what I can, when I can.

On the plus side, the python language and in particular, the
Flask micro-framework is well documented and easy to find the
information needed to complete a task.

So it's just one task at a time, works for me.
Python rocks, and Flask in a joy to work with!

Carry on...

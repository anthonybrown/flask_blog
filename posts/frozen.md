# Frozen Flask
## Build is not working as expected

I can't seem to get the build to work.

I believe it's how I'm using jinja, I have a base template and the the other template files inherit from that base.html file.

I'm letting it import all the css files that way, I'm going to just import the css another way to see if that fixes the build problem?

Going to figure out what the problem is.

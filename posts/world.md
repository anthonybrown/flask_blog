Is JS the language to rule them all?
For me it is, you can use JavaScript on the full stack
now. That's so awesome, I am going to have to really just
know one language to run a modern stack.

Since the release of [node](http://nodejs.org/), how we
build web applications has totally changed the way build.
I can run Node as a server and use MongoDB or CouchDB or
what have you and use JavaScript for the data base layer as well.

Front end, doh, JavaScript and a framework like Backbone or Angular,
forget about it. We're so stoked these days about javascript.

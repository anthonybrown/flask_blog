### Cool huh?, I think so

So, I'm learning Flask because of an interview I had, turns
out this company, Datarobot, uses it, so I thought it would
be a good idea to show them that I have the initiative to learn
something quickly.

*Why not show them the work you've alread done?*

To make a long story short, I zipped up my old server with
all my work on it. I figured I was covered when I deleted half my
hard drive learning how to use the terminal ( I was deleting the ~/.Trash/* when I started
noticing files disapearring from the finder before my very eyes! )

Any hoot, when I went to open up my zip files with all my work since school, I was
completly shocked to find all of them empty!. I've been pretty bummed out about that
but, I just kept on learning new things.

To put salt on the wound, last week I did a small job creating some banner ads and
a party invite for web and print. I decided to try out the cs6 stuff, when I installed
the master collection, I was horrified to find all of my .psd and .ai and whatever Adobe
related files disapeared!, gone, just vanished.

Well as the old adage goes, _'shit happens'_

Made some navigation links in the header, learning quit a bit about flask in general.
I'm really liking this micro-framework.

# Learning Python

###_beginning of a journey_

Python is a wonder and expressive language. It's fairly easy to pick up and learn. There's a ton of resources on the net to learn from and there seem to be a good amount of really smart and powerful tools to work with the language.

Pythons syntax is both beautiful and easy to read, at least for me it is. Working with Python is a a joy, I'm so happy I decided to really take a better look at this language.

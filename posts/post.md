### First moments with flask

 Flask is a micro web framework built with python.

 So far so good, [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/) is amazing!
 the documentation is pretty good, and python in general has a wealth
 of online documentation.

 Flask is pretty intuitive and since it's built with python, the skills are transferable to other
 technologies, unlike DSL's (domain specific languages.) like Sinatra.
 I also like the fact that I can use Markdown to write my blog in.

 So the next step is to start adding css and stuff to this.

# Status of the blog

I've managed to keep moving forward dispite running
into some road blocks. I can't get frozen-flask to work just yet.

So, I put together a fixed header with some navigation. I have a home, about and blog page so far and I'm reading up on adding a contact page.

I'm going to have to figure out the problem with
frozen-flask. It seems that when I push to heroku,
the blog gets broken, none of the links appear.

I spun up a new vps to host my new blog on, but there's no support for that. I'm going to have to
get on IRC channel and see if someone can give me some guidance.

In the meantime, I'll just keep working on things.
Learning a lot about python and Flask in general.

I'm really liking\r\nthe API and the built in debugger rocks! The flask documentation is amazing,\r\nit's easy to find what you are looking for and there's some really neat stuff\r\nfor flask\r\n\r\nThis project was done from the hip so to speak.\r\nThere wasn't any PSD file or design I had in mind.\r\nBasically the styles evolved in the browser. With Chrome Dev tools and \r\nLiveReload as my tools, I just wrote the css in the browser most of the time\r\nto see what looked good.\r\n\r\nAfter I had a basic color scheme going, I just kept it simple and I choose a \r\nsemi-flat style. Since the company wanted to see my frontend skills, I had to\r\nadd some styles that were minimal and tasteful, but more importantly, they had\r\nto enhance the UX (the user experience).\r\n\r\nEvery journey starts with the first step, and I will be taking mine now.\r\n\r\nReally stoked for this job!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

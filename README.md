## Datarobot uses Flask, NPR uses Flask

### Tony Brown is going to use Flask.

Learning a little bit more about python, I'm really liking it and
look forward to learning more about python in general, if Google uses
it to run their apps... enough said.

Flask is turning out to pretty intuitive to work with. I'm really liking
the API and the built in debugger rocks! The flask documentation is amazing,
it's easy to find what you are looking for and there's some really neat stuff
for flask

This project was done from the hip so to speak.
There wasn't any PSD file or design I had in mind.
Basically the styles evolved in the browser. With Chrome Dev tools and 
LiveReload as my tools, I just wrote the css in the browser most of the time
to see what looked good.

After I had a basic color scheme going, I just kept it simple and I choose a 
semi-flat style. Since the company wanted to see my frontend skills, I had to
add some styles that were minimal and tasteful, but more importantly, they had
to enhance the UX (the user experience).

Every journey starts with the first step, and I will be taking mine now.

Really stoked for this job!

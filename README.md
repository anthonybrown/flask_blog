## Datarobot uses Flask, NPR uses Flask

### Tony Brown is going to use Flask.

Learning a little bit more about python, I'm really liking it and
look forward to learning more about python in general, if Google uses
it to run their apps... enough said.

Flask is turning out to pretty intuitive to work with. I'm really liking
the API and the built in debugger rocks! The flask documentation is amazing,
it's easy to find what you are looking for and there's some really neat stuff
for flask.

Every journey starts with the first step, and I will be taking mine now.

Really stoked for this job!

#### Blog I built in Flask for Datarobot interview.

Learning a little bit more about python, I'm really liking it and 
look forward to learning more about python in general, if Google uses
it to run their apps... enough said.

Flask is turning out to pretty intuitive to work with. I'm really liking
the API and the built in debugger rocks

Really stoked for this job!
